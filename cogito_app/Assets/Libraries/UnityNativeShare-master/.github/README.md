# Unity Native Share Plugin

**Available on Asset Store:** https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/native-share-for-android-ios-112731

**Forum Thread:** https://forum.unity.com/threads/native-share-for-android-ios-open-source.519865/

**[Support the Developer â˜•](https://yasirkula.itch.io/unity3d)**

This plugin helps you natively share files (images, videos, documents, etc.) and/or plain text on Android & iOS. A **ContentProvider** is used to share the media on Android. 

## INSTALLATION

There are 5 ways to install this plugin:

- import [NativeShare.unitypackage](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/releases) via *Assets-Import Package*
- clone/[download](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/archive/master.zip) this repository and move the *Plugins* folder to your Unity project's *Assets* folder
- import it from [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/native-share-for-android-ios-112731)
- *(via Package Manager)* add the following line to *Packages/manifest.json*:
  - `"com.yasirkula.nativeshare": "https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare.git",`
- *(via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com))* after installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
  - `openupm add com.yasirkula.nativeshare`

### Android Setup

NativeShare no longer requires any manual setup on Android. If you were using an older version of the plugin, you need to remove NativeShare's `<provider ... />` from your *AndroidManifest.xml*.

For reference, the legacy documentation is available at: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/wiki/Manual-Setup-for-Android

### iOS Setup

There are two ways to set up the plugin on iOS:

- **a. Automated Setup:** *(optional)* change the value of **PHOTO_LIBRARY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION** in *Plugins/NativeShare/Editor/NSPostProcessBuild.cs*
- **b. Manual Setup:** see: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/wiki/Manual-Setup-for-iOS

## HOW TO

Simply create a new **NativeShare** object and customize it by chaining the following functions as you like (see example code):

- `SetSubject( string subject )`: sets the subject (primarily used in e-mail applications)
- `SetText( string text )`: sets the shared text. Note that the Facebook app will omit text, if exists (see [this topic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35102802/2373034))
- `AddFile( string filePath, string mime = null )`: adds the file at path to the share action. You can add multiple files of different types. The MIME of the file is automatically determined if left null; however, if the file doesn't have an extension and/or you already know the MIME of the file, you can enter the MIME manually. MIME has no effect on iOS
- `AddFile( Texture2D texture, string createdFileName = "Image.png" )`: saves the *texture* to *Application.temporaryCachePath* with the specified filename and adds the image file to the share action
- `SetTitle( string title )`: sets the title of the share dialog on Android platform. Has no effect on iOS
- `AddTarget( string androidPackageName, string androidClassName = null )`: shares content on a specific application on Android platform. If *androidClassName* is left null, list of activities in the share dialog will be narrowed down to the activities in the specified *androidPackageName* that can handle this share action. Note that androidClassName, if provided, must be the full name of the activity (with its package). You can call this function multiple times. This function has no effect on iOS
- `SetCallback( ShareResultCallback callback )`: invokes the *callback* function after the share action is completed. **ShareResultCallback** has the following signature: `void ShareResultCallback( ShareResult result, string shareTarget )`
  - `ShareResult result` can take 3 values:
    - **Unknown:** we can't determine whether or not the user has shared the content
	- **Shared:** user has probably shared the content. This value guarantees that the user has at least selected an app from the share sheet. But it is impossible to say whether the user has actually shared the content or cancelled the operation right after selecting the app from the share sheet
	- **NotShared:** either the user has closed the share sheet immediately or selected an app from the share sheet but then decided not to share the content (unfortunately, most apps return *Shared* for the latter case)
  - `string shareTarget` stores information about the app that the user has selected from the share sheet. It can be *null* or empty, if this information isn't provided. Usually, this is the package name/class name of the selected application. You can use this value to e.g. determine if the user has picked Twitter from the share sheet: `shareTarget != null && shareTarget.ToLowerInvariant().Contains( "twitter" )`

Finally, calling the **Share()** function of the NativeShare object will present the share sheet.

## UTILITY FUNCTIONS

- `bool NativeShare.TargetExists( string androidPackageName, string androidClassName = null )`: returns whether the application with the specified package/class name exists on the Android device. If *androidClassName* is left null, only the package name is queried. This function always returns true on iOS
- `bool FindTarget( out string androidPackageName, out string androidClassName, string packageNameRegex, string classNameRegex = null )`: finds the package/class name of an installed application on the Android device using regular expressions. Returns true if a matching package/class name is found successfully. Can be useful when you want to use the *AddTarget* function but don't know the exact package/class name of the target activity. If *classNameRegex* is left null, the first activity in the matching package is returned. This function always returns false on iOS

## FAQ

- **Can I share on a specific app?**

On Android, you can share on a specific app via *AddTarget*. For iOS, you can check out this post and see if it works for you: https://forum.unity.com/threads/native-share-for-android-ios-open-source.519865/page-4#post-4011874

- **I can't share image with text on X app**

It is just not possible to share an image/file with text/subject on some apps (e.g. Facebook), they intentionally omit either the image or the text from the shared content. These apps require you to use their own SDKs for complex share actions. For best compatibility, I'd recommend you to share either only image or only text.

- **Can't share, it says "Can't file ContentProvider, share not possible!" in Logcat**

After building your project, verify that NativeShare's `<provider ... />` tag is inserted in-between the `<application>...</application>` tags of *PROJECT_PATH/Temp/StagingArea/AndroidManifest.xml*. If not, please create a new **Issue**.

- **Can't share, it says "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.yasirkula.unity.NativeShare" in Logcat**

If your project uses ProGuard, try adding the following line to ProGuard filters: `-keep class com.yasirkula.unity.* { *; }`

## EXAMPLE CODE

The following code captures the screenshot of the game whenever you tap the screen, saves it in a temporary path and then shares it:

```csharp
void Update()
{
	if( Input.GetMouseButtonDown( 0 ) )
		StartCoroutine( TakeScreenshotAndShare() );
}

private IEnumerator TakeScreenshotAndShare()
{
	yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();

	Texture2D ss = new Texture2D( Screen.width, Screen.height, TextureFormat.RGB24, false );
	ss.ReadPixels( new Rect( 0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height ), 0, 0 );
	ss.Apply();

	string filePath = Path.Combine( Application.temporaryCachePath, "shared img.png" );
	File.WriteAllBytes( filePath, ss.EncodeToPNG() );

	// To avoid memory leaks
	Destroy( ss );

	new NativeShare().AddFile( filePath )
		.SetSubject( "Subject goes here" ).SetText( "Hello world!" )
		.SetCallback( ( result, shareTarget ) => Debug.Log( "Share result: " + result + ", selected app: " + shareTarget ) )
		.Share();

	// Share on WhatsApp only, if installed (Android only)
	//if( NativeShare.TargetExists( "com.whatsapp" ) )
	//	new NativeShare().AddFile( filePath ).AddTarget( "com.whatsapp" ).Share();
}
```

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- Gif files are shared as static images on iOS (to learn more, please see this issue: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/issues/22)
